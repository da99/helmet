# Helmet

You want the original version:

[https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)

This Helmet is only for module Cloudflare workers developed on Deno. That is
very specific. You don't want this. 

# Lockdown those header values the lazy/default way:

```typescript
  import { helmet } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/da99/helmet.ts/main/index.ts";
  const r = new Response();
  helmet(r);
```

## Quick start

  * Learn JavaScript.
  * Learn TypeScript.
  * Learn Deno.
  * Learn ESM (ie ECMAScript) modules.
  * Learn Cloudflare Workers.
  * Give up and get a real job outside of software.

## Running the tests:

  * Have Deno installed and in your $PATH.
  * `bin/test`
